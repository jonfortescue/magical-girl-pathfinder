Transformation Sequence	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Magical Girl Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.1	DESC:Unlike most mages, a magical girl is not a generalist, but a specialist, usually a combat specialist, and generally expected to absorb not-insignificant amounts of punishment. As such, one of the first things they learn at 2nd level is the ability to turn their regular clothing into a protective suit of armor, often somewhat outlandish in appearance, depending on the magical girl's tastes. However, even if their transformed appearance is identical to their regular appearance, the magical girl will not be recognized as herself unless the observer sees her transform, or succeeds on a Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 class level + Charisma modifier) - they may make this Will save whenever they have detected the magical girl to a sufficient degree of precision as to be able to identify her (whether hearing her voice, or seeing her, or using another appropriate sense). If they fail this save, the magical girl's transformed and untransformed identities are not known to be the same person, and they may only attempt this save upon seeing her in the future if their Will save modifier has increased from its level when they failed the check.<br/><br/>The transformation requires a full-round action, at will, and replaces a magical girl's current clothing or armour with a costume that provides an armor bonus equal to their caster level, with no chance of arcane spell failure or armour check penalty. This is regular armor, however, regardless of its source, and does not apply to incorporeal or touch attacks.<br/><br/>The Transformation Sequence will last ten minutes per caster level per day, staying active until the time runs out or until the magical girl chooses to dispel it again. The magical girl may transform as many times per day as they wish, so long as they have time remaining for the day.

# All Night Long				SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  All Night Long			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Magical girls often lead double lives, as normal civilians during the day and using their powers at night. As such, they quickly learn to function on less sleep than most, only needing to rest half the amount of time they would normally require at second level.
# Device						SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Device					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Most magical girls use a special focus item to assist in the use of their powers. At 3rd level, the magical girl automatically gains one item - usually a weapon, but magical girls have also been known to use such diverse items as a small computer, cellular phones, holy symbols, and household implements. If this item is a weapon, can be used as a weapon, or is another object the magical girl is not proficient in the use of (such as a computer for a magical girl lacking technological savvy), she automatically gains proficiency and Weapon Specialization in the use of that item, and all items of its type (for instance, if it is a longsword she gains proficiency and Weapon Specialization with longswords, though no other martial weapons). This item is counted as a masterwork item, and may be enchanted.<br/><br/>The device can be turned into a storage form, an innocuous item (such as a pendant) that does not register as magical unless enchantments have been purchased, and returned to its full device form as either an action taking as long as the magical girl's transformation sequence, or a free action accompanying her transformation sequence.<br/><br/>The device takes part of the mental workload of triggering a magical girl's powers off of the magical girl, making it easier, and therefore quicker - all formulas requiring a full-round action now require a standard action, so long as the magical girl's device is in her possession, and in full item form, not storage form. The magical girl's device may be enchanted like any other weapon (if it is not a weapon, it may still be enchanted with costs as a weapon). The device's magical enhancement bonus applies to the to-hit and damage of all formulas used with the device as well as its own weapon use, unless otherwise stated in the formula description, and the device's composition (special materials cost must be paid in gp) and alignment also count for penetrating damage reduction.<br/><br/>If a magical girl's device is lost or destroyed, she may acquire another by focusing for forty-eight hours. These need not be consecutive, but her device will not appear until all forty-eight hours have been completed. The precise nature of this focus varies by the nature of the magical girl - some will draw the device out of their souls, others will be making it as a technological item, and still others have even more esoteric means. This replacement device will not possess any enchantments that the original did - it will be completely non-magical until the enchantments are replaced.
# Improved transformation		SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Improved Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, the magical girl may invoke her transformation sequence as a standard action.
# Defense Data				SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Defense Data			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Over time, a magical girl learns to enhance their battle outfit so as to cut down on the chinks that allow small but hostile chemicals and life forms through. At 7th level a magical girl becomes immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, so long as her transformation sequence is active.
# Rapid Transformation		SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Rapid Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, the magical girl may now invoke her transformation sequence as a move action.
# Improved Defense Data		SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Improved Defense Data	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, the magical girl gains immunity to all poisons while her transformation sequence is active.
# Instant Transformation		SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Instant Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 14th level the transformation sequence becomes a swift action.
# Suffused Transformation		SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Suffused Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 15th level, the magic suffusing the magical girl's armour is strong enough to serve as its own defence, making it difficult for magical attacks to penetrate. At this point, the magical girl's transformation sequence applies against touch attacks.
# Environmental Seal			SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Environmental Seal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 18th level, a magical girl becomes so precise with the creation of her battle outfit that it becomes a bubble of space completely disconnected from the world around her. She becomes immune to the following environmental effects as long as her transformation sequence is active: Nonlethal damage from cold. Nonlethal damage from heat. Suffocation or lack of air (and since she does not need to breathe, she is also immune to drowning and smoke inhalation).

# Active Formula				SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Active Formula			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A magical girl is not a spellcaster - though she most certainly manipulates magical energy, she does so in a limited set of ways, highly complex formulae which are either imprinted into her mind, or simply memorized. However, in exchange for her loss of versatility, a magical girl gains endurance - her formulae drain significantly less energy than most other magical effects, and she is capable of keeping them up as long as any other fighter is capable of battling. For spell-like abilities and all effects based on caster level, a magical girl has a caster level equal to her class level. A magical girl's spell-like abilities may be considered equivalent to a spell of half her level (for instance, a level 8 magical girl's formulae will be equivalent to level 4 spells) for purposes of being cast defensively, spellcraft checks to determine the effect, and all similar aspects relating to spell level. Note that a magical girl's formulae are spell-like abilities, not spells, and she is not permitted to employ metamagic feats to them. Meta-spell-like ability feats may, however, be employed as described in their appropriate book. A magical girl may employ her formulae to counterspell an opposing magical girl's formulae - as a standard counterspell, she must ready her action, successfully make a DC 15 + spell-level-equivalent Spellcraft check when her opponent initiates her ability, and then cast the same formula that the opposing magical girl is using (it need not match the opponent's elemental attributes). If the target of the opposing magical girl's formula is within range of the countering magical girl, the formula is negated.
# Passive Formula				SOURCEPAGE:p. 1		KEY:Magical Girl ~  Passive Formula			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Passive formulae function as active formulae but derive from a different pool.
