###Block: Magical Girl Abilities (Base)
Transformation Sequence	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Unlike most mages, a magical girl is not a generalist, but a specialist, usually a combat specialist, and generally expected to absorb not-insignificant amounts of punishment. As such, one of the first things they learn at 2nd level is the ability to turn their regular clothing into a protective suit of armor, often somewhat outlandish in appearance, depending on the magical girl's tastes. However, even if their transformed appearance is identical to their regular appearance, the magical girl will not be recognized as herself unless the observer sees her transform, or succeeds on a Will save (DC %1) - they may make this Will save whenever they have detected the magical girl to a sufficient degree of precision as to be able to identify her (whether hearing her voice, or seeing her, or using another appropriate sense). If they fail this save, the magical girl's transformed and untransformed identities are not known to be the same person, and they may only attempt this save upon seeing her in the future if their Will save modifier has increased from its level when they failed the check.|20+MagicalGirlLVL/2+CHA	DESC:The transformation requires a full-round action, at will, and replaces a magical girl's current clothing or armour with a costume that provides an armor bonus equal to their caster level, with no chance of arcane spell failure or armour check penalty. This is regular armor, however, regardless of its source, and does not apply to incorporeal or touch attacks. The Transformation Sequence will last ten minutes per caster level per day, staying active until the time runs out or until the magical girl chooses to dispel it again. The magical girl may transform as many times per day as they wish, so long as they have time remaining for the day.
All Night Long			KEY:Magical Girl ~ All Night Long			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Magical girls often lead double lives, as normal civilians during the day and using their powers at night. As such, they quickly learn to function on less sleep than most.	DESC: The magical girl only needs to rest for half the normal amount they'd normally require.
Device					KEY:Magical Girl ~ Device					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Most magical girls use a special focus item to assist in the use of their powers.		DESC:At 3rd level, the magical girl automatically gains one item - usually a weapon, but magical girls have also been known to use such diverse items as a small computer, cellular phones, holy symbols, and household implements. If this item is a weapon, can be used as a weapon, or is another object the magical girl is not proficient in the use of (such as a computer for a magical girl lacking technological savvy), she automatically gains proficiency and Weapon Specialization in the use of that item, and all items of its type (for instance, if it is a longsword she gains proficiency and Weapon Specialization with longswords, though no other martial weapons). This item is counted as a masterwork item, and may be enchanted.<br/><br/>The device can be turned into a storage form, an innocuous item (such as a pendant) that does not register as magical unless enchantments have been purchased, and returned to its full device form as either an action taking as long as the magical girl's transformation sequence, or a free action accompanying her transformation sequence.<br/><br/>The device takes part of the mental workload of triggering a magical girl's powers off of the magical girl, making it easier, and therefore quicker - all formulas requiring a full-round action now require a standard action, so long as the magical girl's device is in her possession, and in full item form, not storage form. The magical girl's device may be enchanted like any other weapon (if it is not a weapon, it may still be enchanted with costs as a weapon). The device's magical enhancement bonus applies to the to-hit and damage of all formulas used with the device as well as its own weapon use, unless otherwise stated in the formula description, and the device's composition (special materials cost must be paid in gp) and alignment also count for penetrating damage reduction.<br/><br/>If a magical girl's device is lost or destroyed, she may acquire another by focusing for forty-eight hours. These need not be consecutive, but her device will not appear until all forty-eight hours have been completed. The precise nature of this focus varies by the nature of the magical girl - some will draw the device out of their souls, others will be making it as a technological item, and still others have even more esoteric means. This replacement device will not possess any enchantments that the original did - it will be completely non-magical until the enchantments are replaced.
Defense Data			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Defense Data				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Over time, a magical girl learns to enhance their battle outfit so as to cut down on the chinks that allow small but hostile chemicals and life forms through.		DESC:At 7th level a magical girl becomes immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, so long as her transformation sequence is active.
Suffused Transformation	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Suffused Transformation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 15th level, the magic suffusing the magical girl's armour is strong enough to serve as its own defence, making it difficult for magical attacks to penetrate. 	DESC: The magical girl's transformation sequence applies against touch attacks.
Environmental Seal		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Environmental Seal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 18th level, a magical girl becomes so precise with the creation of her battle outfit that it becomes a bubble of space completely disconnected from the world around her.	DESC:She becomes immune to the following environmental effects as long as her transformation sequence is active: Nonlethal damage from cold. Nonlethal damage from heat. Suffocation or lack of air (and since she does not need to breathe, she is also immune to drowning and smoke inhalation).

###Block: Formulae Abilities
Formula						KEY:Magical Girl ~ Formula						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MagicalGirlClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:A magical girl is not a spellcaster - though she most certainly manipulates magical energy, she does so in a limited set of ways, highly complex formulae which are either imprinted into her mind, or simply memorized. However, in exchange for her loss of versatility, a magical girl gains endurance - her formulae drain significantly less energy than most other magical effects, and she is capable of keeping them up as long as any other fighter is capable of battling.<br/><br/>The magical girl gains one Active Formula of her choice at level 1, and may choose another every 4 levels thereafter (5, 9, 13, and 17), she gains a Passive Formula every 4 levels (4, 8, 12, and 16), and may choose either at levels 19 and 20.

###Block: Active Formulae
Focused Shot		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Focused Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		MULT:YES	STACK:NO	CHOOSE:STRING|Acid|Cold|Fire|Lightning		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,1	DESC:Most magical girls specialize in one thing - shooting at full power. And this is, indeed, what they are best at. Whether it be calling down a lightning bolt from the sky, or blasting their foe with a beam of concentrated magic, destroying the enemy is the forte of the magical girl.		DESC:The Focused Shot either entirely deals <b>%1</b> damage or half <b>%1</b> damage and half of a physical type (piercing, bludgeoning, slashing) - the character must decide upon selecting the ability, and this cannot be changed.<br/><br/>The Focused Shot is a full-round action (reduced to a standard action if the magical girl has an active Device on hand), ranged touch attack, with a range of %2 feet. Presuming it hits, it deals 1d6 damage per caster level. Even if granted another standard action by any means, the magical girl may still only fire one Focused Shot or Bullet Hell burst in a turn.<br/><br/>The magical girl's Device's enhancement bonus applies to the bullet, adding both to its to-hit and its damage. Note that spell resistance applies to this formula, as do damage reduction (if partially physical), and energy resistance or immunity of the type selected.<br/><br/>This formula uses more energy than most, each use reducing the amount of time the magical girl can remain transformed for that day by 1 minute.<br/><br/>This formula may be selected multiple times. Multiple selections do not stack, she may simply select another energy type mix from the available selections. Even if purchased multiple times, she still may only fire one per turn.|%CHOICE|FocusedShotRange
Bullet Hell			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Bullet Hell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		MULT:YES	STACK:NO	CHOOSE:STRING|Piercing|Bludgeoning|Slashing|Acid|Cold|Fire|Lightning	PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,1	DESC:While most magical girls favour focused power on one part of one target, there is something to be said for the 'far too many attacks for sane beings to evade' philosophy. Magical girls who select Bullet Hell tend to ascribe to this philosophy, or at least like having the option open. While the term 'bullet' is used, this is solely for simplicity - a magical girl's bullets may be flying knives, fireballs, ball lightning, or almost anything else that fits into its game effects. The bullets do <b>%1</b> damage.|%CHOICE		DESC:The magical girl gains the ability to, once per round as a full-round action (reduced to a standard action if the magical girl has an active Device on hand), create a number of bullets up to her caster level. These bullets contain a total amount of damage equal to 1d6 per caster level, which the magical girl may distribute among her bullets as she likes - for instance, a 13th-level magical girl may create a single 13d6 bullet, thirteen 1d6 bullets, a 7d6 and a 6d6 bullet, three 3d6s and one 4d6, or any other allotment, so long as she does not create more bullets than her caster level, or a total amount of damage greater than 1d6 per caster level.<br/><br/>Upon having created these bullets, the magical girl may fire them all as a free action - while she may select any number of targets, each bullet cannot go beyond a range of %1 feet, and each bullet must be fired simultaneously (she may not hold half of them back to see if the first half killed the target and she may move them onto the next). Each bullet requires its own ranged touch attack to hit.<br/><br/>The magical girl's Device's enhancement bonus applies individually to each bullet, adding both to its to-hit and its damage. However, damage reduction and energy resistance also apply individually to each bullet, which sharply reduces the punch if there is any at all.<br/><br/>This formula uses more energy than most, each use reducing the amount of time the magical girl can remain transformed for that day by 1 minute.<br/><br/>Note that spell resistance applies to this formula, as do damage reduction and energy resistance or immunity as appropriate. Spell resistance only applies once to a specific magical girl's barrage per turn - if she defeats the resistance, all of her attacks get through, if she does not, none of them get through.<br/><br/>This formula may be selected multiple times. Multiple selections do not stack, she may simply select another energy type mix from the available selections. Even if purchased multiple times, she still may only fire one barrage per turn. She may, however, make each bullet be of any energy type available to her - for instance, if the above example level 13 magical girl possessed four selections of Bullet Hell for slashing, acid, fire, and lightning, she may make a 3d6 acid bullet, a 3d6 fire bullet, a 3d6 lightning bullet, and a 4d6 slashing bullet in one turn.|BulletHellRange
Bind				KEY:Magical Girl ~ Bind					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,1	DESC:Sometimes, magical girls are supposed to capture or arrest their opponents, as opposed to blowing them into a steaming heap of once-living matter. Magical girls who find themselves in such situations usually learn how to lock down an opponent, wrapping them in magical power that stops their movement and prevents their own magic from working properly.	DESC:As a full-round action (reduced to a standard action if she has her Device active), the magical girl may attempt to bind one creature within a range of %1 feet. The target may attempt a Reflex save (DC %2) to negate. If it succeeds, target is pinned as in a grapple - immobile but not helpless, threatens no squares, loses Dexterity bonus to AC and takes an additional -4 AC penalty against all opponents. The target may perform no actions except for purely mental or verbal actions, and cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities. The bind lasts for 1 minute per caster level. Every round on its turn, the target may attempt a grapple check, an Escape Artist check, or if they have caster levels, a caster level + casting statistic (Int/Wis/Cha) - against a DC %3 to escape the bind - this is a full-round action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.|FocusedShotRange|10+MagicalGirlLVL/2+CHA|10+MagicalGirlLVL+CHA
Deflection Barrier	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Deflection Barrier	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|if(CHA>MagicalGirlLVL,MagicalGirlLVL,CHA)|TYPE=Deflection		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,1	DESC:Magical girls, as a general rule, do not like getting shot at. Few people do like getting shot at, but magical girls can do something about it - namely, put up a force field to block all attacks. A magical girl who selects this formula gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier, with a maximum equal to her levels in Magical Girl.		DESC:The magical girl may, at will on her turn, grant this barrier to another creature within 100 feet - she will lose the benefits of her barrier as long as it is granted to someone else.<br/><br/>This formula may be purchased multiple times - each additional purchase doubles the amount of creatures she may enclose in her barrier to grant this deflection bonus, though they must be adjacent to either the magical girl, or another character enclosed in her barrier.<br/><br/>If those enclosed in her barrier are of a different size than the magical girl, they will count as doubling the amount of creatures enclosed for every size category larger than the magical girl, or halving the amount of creatures enclosed for every size category smaller. For instance, a Medium magical girl with three purchases of Deflection Barrier has space for four in her barrier - she may defend four Medium creatures, two Large creatures, a single Huge creature, or eight Small creatures.<br/><br/>This is a deflection bonus - if the magical girl, or any of those defended by her barrier, possesses a ring of deflection, they do not stack, only the highest bonus applies.|10+MagicalGirlLVL/2+CHA
Point Barrier		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Point Barrier		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,1	DESC:It's not exactly uncommon, that a magical girl's passive armor is just not enough for what her foes are throwing at her. Sometimes even agility doesn't make up the difference, and that's when the magical girl needs to actively focus on her defences, throwing up a small force field to block and deflect incoming strikes.	DESC:The magical girl may expend one attack of opportunity (and if she is unable to make an attack of opportunity, such as if she is flatfooted or has run out of attacks of opportunity for the round, she may not use a Point Barrier) to give herself a shield bonus equal to her Charisma modifier against one attack. This shield bonus does apply against incorporeal and touch attacks, unlike a normal shield.
Spread Shot			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Spread Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula	MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Focused Shot	DESC:While the majority of magical girls prefer to take down one target at a time, sometimes, especially in military utilities, it's more effective to shoot at a whole lot at once.	DESC:A magical girl gains the ability to, at will, make her Focused Shot a Spread Shot. She may choose any point within her Focused Shot's range (though if she wishes to have it detonate on the other side of a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit, she must 'hit' the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the Spread Shot strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely). The Spread Shot has a radius of 20 feet, and all within that radius must make a Reflex save (DC %1) to take half the Focused Shot's damage - if they fail, they will take full damage.<br/><br/>If the magical girl chooses to center the Spread Shot on herself, it is considered to be emanating from her, and she sustains no damage - if it is not centered on her and she is in its radius, however, she must make a Reflex save or sustain full damage, as normal.<br/><br/>This formula may be chosen multiple times. Each selection increases the radius by +20 feet, though the magical girl may opt to use a smaller radius than her maximum at will.|10+MagicalGirlLVL/2+CHA
Raging Storm		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Raging Storm			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula	PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,14	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Focused Shot	DESC:The magical girl generally fights with a fair amount of precision, carefully selecting targets and directing enough firepower to suppress them. But sometimes things get bad, and that's when the magical girl says 'screw it' and sends wild power everywhere in a desperate attempt to get everything down.		DESC:At will, the magical girl may turn any of her Focused Shots into a Raging Storm. A Raging Storm takes two full-round actions to perform (an active device will reduce this to a single round), and the magical girl is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC while performing it. The Raging Storm generates up to two 10 foot cubes per caster level. All of these cubes must be placed within her Focused Shot's usual range. All creatures within one of these cubes sustains her Focused Shot's normal damage (1d6 per caster level, of whichever type she designated when choosing her Focused Shot), and are permitted a Reflex save (%1) to halve this damage.|10+MagicalGirlLVL/2+CHA
Seal Break			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Seal Break			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Animal Advisor		SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MagicalGirlLVL|Animal Growth,10+CHA	DESC:Sometimes, a magical girl's companion isn't quite using their full potential. Maybe the magical girl can charge them with power, maybe they're holding back their full power for personal reasons. For whatever reason, the magical girl can now make them go all-out.		DESC:The magical girl gains Animal Growth as a spell-like ability. This ability may only be used on her Animal Advisor.
Flash Move			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Flash Move			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,10	SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MagicalGirlLVL|Teleport,10+CHA|PREVARLT:MagicalGirlLVL,16	SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MagicalGirlLVL|Teleport (Greater),10+CHA|PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,16	DESC:Magical girls, being... magical... tend not to quite be limited by mundane things such as 'distance', and some are capable of teleporting to their intended destinations.		DESC:The magical girl gains Teleport as a spell-like ability.<br/><br/>At level 16 experience with constantly using this method of transportation the spell-like ability is replaced with Greater Teleport which has no range limit and no chance of appearing off target. You may attempt to teleport to a destination based on information alone and if the information is incorrect you reappear at your original location.
Transfer			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Transfer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		PREVARGTEQ:MagicalGirlLVL,14	SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MagicalGirlLVL|Plane Shift,10+CHA	DESC:Some magical girls are not, in fact, native to this world, and some are members or associates of a multi-world organization. For those magical girls, even more important than doing the job is getting here from home to do it, and getting home from here once it's done.	DESC:The rare magical girl that needs and acquires Transfer is granted Plane Shift as a spell-like ability which can be cast three times per day.
Shift Form			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Shift Form			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		DESC:Most magical girls prefer to fight as themselves, but some are transformers, or infiltrators, reshaping their body and behavior to suit the needs of the moment.	DESC:The magical girl possesses Change Shape, as the monster ability, summarized here for completeness: As a standard action, she may assume the appearance of a specific creature or type of creature. She will retain her own type and subtype, but gain the size of the new form. She loses the natural weapons and natural movement modes of her original form, as well as any extraordinary special attacks of her original form, but retains all abilities derived from class levels. She gains the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of her new form. She retains her own ability scores, hit dice, hit points, skill ranks, feats, base attack bonus, save bonuses, and all other statistics of her original form not specified as changing. She retains all spellcasting ability of her original form, but must be able to speak intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic components - magical girl formulae do not possess somatic or verbal components (though they tend to add them for fun), but this may be a concern for a magical girl multiclassed with a spellcasting class. She is effectively disguised as a creature of her new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if using this ability to create a disguise. Any gear worn or carried that her new form cannot wear or carry simply falls to the ground in her space - if she changes size, any gear that can be worn or carried changes size to match the new size.
Healing				KEY:Magical Girl ~ Healing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		DESC:While magical girls tend to be warriors, there are many who like to heal the wounds they are unable to prevent, and develop a knack for healing.	DESC:The magical girl gains the ability to heal a number of HP equal to her Charisma modifier (maximum +3) times her class level, at will. Doing so requires her to touch the one or ones to be healed, and requires a full-round action (reduced to a standard action if she has an active Device). This healing is not positive energy, and does not damage undead - it heals them as well.<br/><br/>As the hazards become nastier a healing Magical Girl at level 10 is granted additional skills to restore one temporarily or one permanently drained point single ability score of choice per casting and also is able to remove one temporary or permanent or negative level per week.<br/><br/>At level 14 a Magical Girl is also able to immediately end any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting a single target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned three times per day.
Boost Up			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Boost Up				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		DESC:The magical girl gains one of the ability increase spells (Bear's Endurance, Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace, Eagle's Splendor, Fox's Cunning, Owl's Wisdom) with the following adjustments: First, it may be cast at will, as a full-round action (reduced to a standard action if the magical girl has her Device active and in her possession). Second, it grants an enhancement bonus of +6 to the appropriate ability score rather than +4. Third, it lasts only one minute per magical girl caster level. This formula may be acquired any number of times, but the magical girl cannot stack the same bonus - it must be another ability increase spell.
Ghost Mirage		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Ghost Mirage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula		MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE		BONUS:VAR|GhostMirageLevel|1	SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MagicalGirlLVL|Mirror Image|PREVARLTEQ:GhostMirageLevel,1	SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MagicalGirlLVL|Persistent Image|PREVARGTEQ:GhostMirageLevel,2		DESC:While most magical girls are straight-up fighters, some are tricksters and find they get a great deal of mileage out of giving their opponents things that are not them to shoot at.	DESC:The magical girl gains Minor Image as a spell-like ability usable at will. This formula can be acquired twice - the second assignment will upgrade the Ghost Mirage to Persistent Image.
Anti-Magic Field	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Anti-Magic Field		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlActiveFormula	MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE		BONUS:VAR|AMFRange|30	DESC:The magical girl specializes in shutting down other spellcasters.		DESC:If the magical girl has spell resistance, she may put up an AMF as a full-round action. The AMF will last for one minute, and is a %1 foot emanation centered on the Magical Girl. If a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect is activated within the area of the Anti-Magic Field, the caster must make a caster level check against the magical girl's spell resistance. Should the caster level check fail, the ability fizzles, and is considered to have been used up. Continuing spell effects, but not magic items or supernatural abilities, must also make this check and if failed will end as if their duration had expired. This applies to the magical girl's own spell-like abilities as well; she may only freely use her abilities if they are modified by the Influent Skill formula, or else she too needs to make caster level checks against herself. Additional purchases of the AMF formula add an additional +30 foot radius of the emanation.|AMFRange

And then every so often, one sees a magical girl with a knack for putting a bundle of magic precisely on target, even when said target is no larger than a dot at that range.		DESC:A magical girl who selects this formula may choose either her Focused Shot, her Bullet Hell, or her Bind abilities. It will grant Focused Shot or Bind a range of Long (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level), or Bullet Hell a range of Medium (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). This will apply to all energy types she is capable of using with Focused Shot or Bullet Hell - she need only purchase it three times to fully upgrade all three abilities.
Elemental Focus			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Elemental Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Focused Shot],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Enhanced Attack]	DESC:Some magical girls deal damage with somewhat more obscure damage types than normal, such as sound, shadows, light...	DESC:The magical girl may select one of her Focused Shot or Enhanced Attack energy types - it now does damage of either Sonic, Dessication (as Horrid Wilting) or Force type.
Sensory Enhancement		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Sensory Enhancement		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	BONUS:VISION|Darkvision|SensoryEnhancementRange		DESC:Magical girls are often required to fight in rather unusual situations, against rather unusual opponents - a significant portion of a magical girl's fighting is done at night, and tracking targets can quite easily be a magical girl's specialty.	DESC:The magical girl gains Darkvision out to 60 feet. This formula may be selected any number of times.
Elemental Resistance	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Elemental Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	CHOOSE:STRING|Acid|Cold|Fire|Lightning	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	DESC:Magical girls are specialized fighters, and many have a certain degree of control or resistance to some elements.		DESC:The magical girl has Resistance %1 (CL) to %2 damage. This formula may be selected multiple times, but its effects do not stack - it simply gives her resistance to another energy type.|MagicalGirlLVL|%CHOICE
Battle Armor			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Battle Armor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	DESC:The magical girl's transformed state is extraordinarily resistant to punishment, making it very difficult for small attacks to so much as scratch her.		DESC:The magical girl, while transformed only, gains DR %1 (half her CL).|MagicalGirlLVL/2
Physical Enhancement	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Physical Enhancement		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	DESC:The magical girl's body is heavily enhanced by the magic flowing through it, making her stronger, faster, tougher, smarter, more aware, more confident and able to perform feats that she honestly shouldn't be capable of.	DESC:The magical girl, while transformed, gains a +4 inherent bonus to any one ability score, or a +2 inherent bonus to any two ability scores for each assignment of this formula, which must be chosen when this formula is assigned. (If Constitution is increased, her hit points increase to match her new Con score, like a barbarian's rage. Also like a barbarian's rage, these hit points go away when she detransforms, and are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.)
Animal Advisor			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Animal Advisor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	DESC:Many magical girls do not go it alone - they're often assisted by a pet or advisor.	DESC:While the class feature is called Animal Advisor, the Animal Advisor can be any creature with a CR + Character Level of 1, at first level. The Animal Advisor's allowed level and natural armor increase as the Druid's Animal Companion, though it does not gain Str/Dex adjustment, bonus tricks, or any of the Animal Companion's special features. This formula may only be chosen once, and if the Animal Advisor takes any levels of Magical Girl, they may not select the Animal Advisor Formula.
Flight					KEY:Magical Girl ~ Flight					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula		MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE	BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Fly|30	DESC:Many magical girls don't really feel like being bound by trivial things like gravity - they prefer not to have their hunting limited to only what they can reach.	DESC:A magical girl who selects this formula is granted a fly speed of 30 feet, with good maneuverability. This formula may be selected any number of times - each selection increases her fly speed by 30 feet and (on the second selection) improves her maneuverability to perfect.
Telepathy				KEY:Magical Girl ~ Telepathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula		DESC:While some magical girls operate solo, many are team fighters, or members of a military organization, and find it important to be able to communicate and coordinate with their fellows.	DESC:The magical girl gains Telepathy, as the monster ability - she may communicate telepathically with any other creature within a range of 100 feet per caster level that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, but maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.
Influent Skill			KEY:Magical Girl ~ Influent Skill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	MULT:YES	STACK:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE		DESC:The magical girl is not, in fact, a magical girl - one or more of her abilities functions on some other basis than magic, whether it be ki, technological emulation, or something else.	DESC:Every time this ability is selected, choose one of the magical girl's spell-like or supernatural abilities. That ability becomes an extraordinary ability instead.
Magical Resistance		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Magical Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Magical Girl ~ Transformation Sequence	SR:10+MagicalGirlLVL	DESC:Having been hit many times by magic, the magical girl has finally figured out how to negate it.	DESC:The magical girl gains spell resistance equal to 10 + her magical girl level, only when transformed.
Magic Penetration		KEY:Magical Girl ~ Magic Penetration		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	DESC:Some magical girls specialize in fighting under dispel-heavy conditions.	DESC:The magical girl gains +4 to caster level checks for the purposes of defeating spell resistance and resisting dispels.
Awesomeness By Analysis	KEY:Magical Girl ~ Awesomeness By Analysis	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.MagicalGirlFormula.MagicalGirlPassiveFormula	DESC:While many magical girls blow through problems on guts and reflexes, every so often one pops up that thinks their way through their situations. This magical girl's analysis and tactical abilities, while rarely overpowering, can most definitely serve as a wedge to perform what was theoretically supposed to be impossible, as she learns her foe's patterns and predicts their future actions.		DESC:For every round the magical girl has observed her opponent in battle, she gains use of Awesomeness By Analysis for one round against that opponent. Awesomeness By Analysis allows the magical girl to gain an insight bonus to AC and attack rolls equal to her Intelligence modifier against all known opponents, so long as she has uses remaining. She may choose to grant this bonus to any ally, if she wishes. For instance, a magical girl is fighting against three orcs within her visual range of 60 feet. One wizard is standing in the corner, but has not acted yet, observing for his own amusement. For the first round, she may act as normal. On the second round, she may trigger Awesomeness By Analysis, to gain her insight bonus - however, it will only apply against the orcs, because she has not seen the wizard act enough to discern any form of pattern. If she chooses to reserve it and act normally for the second round, she may now have Awesomeness By Analysis active for the third and fourth rounds of the battle. If a goblin comes out from hiding within her visual radius, or a new monster steps into the battlefield from beyond her visual radius, she must wait to observe them for one round before gaining a use of Awesomeness By Analysis against them.

Select one energy type (acid, cold, fire, lightning) - the magical girl now takes half-again (+50 percent) of the damage from all attacks consisting of this type, as the Vulnerability to Energy monster trait. This is not a formula, it is a defect, and if taken, grants the character one extra formula.	COST:0
