# Magical Girl Class for Pathfinder

A PCGen implementation of a Magical Girl homebrew class. Based on [this 3.5e class](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Magical_Girl_(3.5e_Class))
with modifications as follows:

* Hit die upped to d8 from d6
* Class skill changes:
  * Tumble &rightarrow; Acrobatics
  * Spot &rightarrow; Perception
  * Concentration &rightarrow; Use Magic Device (since concentration is not a skill in Pathfinder)
* Added an analogous path for shield Devices
  * Taking a shield as your device gives Shield Proficiency, Shield Focus, and Shield Specialization
* Elemental Focus formula can now also be applied to Bullet Hell formula
* Level requirements for Raging Storm, Flash Move, and Transfer all reduced by 1

## To Do
* Add teamwork feats?

## Level 20 Capstone &ndash; Legendary Form & Legendary Formula
Once per day, while the Transformation Sequence is active, a magical girl may transform into a Legendary form. While in Legendary form, she
gains a +2 bonus to all her ability scores and saves and rolls d8s for her Formulae damage rather than d6s, but she burns through her time
she can stay transformed at five times the normal rate. Also while transformed, she gains access to one Legendary Formula that she can
select upon reaching level 20.

### Ultimate Strike
Thrice per Legendary Transformation, a magical girl can declare an Ultimate Strike at the beginning of her turn. On each successful attack,
she automatically deals maximum damage, including any critical damage. (This only applies to attacks with to-hit rolls, not spell-like
abilities which require saves.)

### Fragtime
Six times per Legendary Transformation, a magical girl can use Time Stop as a spell-like ability.
